# I Want To Wish You A Happy Birthday 

This is a simple birthday website that I created for my friend Kevin. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this website. I also used some images and gifs that I found on the internet. I hope you like it!

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Customize the website to your liking by using the customizer panel.
4. Export the configuration to share with your friends.
5. Import the configuration on their end to see the changes.

- Birthday Person's Name
- Age
- Date
- Photo URL
